To keep things rolling, I've released another project called Reserved Word Search. With Reserved Word Search you can instantly find reserved words as you type. This is extremely useful when doing database design and/or designing an API.

So go ahead and check out Reserved Word Search @ [www.reservedwordsearch.com](http://www.reservedwordsearch.com).
