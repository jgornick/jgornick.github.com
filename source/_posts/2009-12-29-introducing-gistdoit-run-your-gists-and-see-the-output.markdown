For the past couple of months, I've been working on a mashup service between [gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com) and [ideone.com](http://ideone.com). The service allows someone to execute a gist and view the results.

For more information, please check out GistDoIt! @ [www.gistdoit.com](http://www.gistdoit.com).
